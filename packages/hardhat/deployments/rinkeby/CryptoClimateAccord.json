The Accord has two specific interim objectives:  Objective 1: Achieve net-zero emissions from electricity consumption for CCA Signatories by 2030.  Objective 2: Develop standards, tools, and technologies with CCA Supporters to accelerate the adoption of and verify progress toward 100% renewably-powered blockchains by the 2025 UNFCCC COP30 conference.  Moreover, by signing this transaction, the Signatory, affirms its public commitment to achieve net-zero emissions  from electricity consumption associated with all of its crypto-related operations and to report progress toward this net-zero emissions target using best industry practices.  By signing and submitting this transaction, Signatory permits full public recognition (including the use of Signatory’s logo and references in public communications) and responsibilities of this commitment.  Please submit the transaction hash via email to the Crypto Climate Accord to formalize this commitment and put this commitment on record. If Signatory decides to withdraw its commitment, then Signatory must submit its withdrawal in writing to Energy Web to formalize its withdrawal as a Signatory."
